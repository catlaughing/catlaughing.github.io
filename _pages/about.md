A self-motivated university student that loves to play around data and building machine learning model. Already build some deep learning models around Image Classification and Natural Language problem. Have won 3rd place in two national-level Data Science Competition and Finalist in one. Have done a data science internship before and was responsible to come up and build a strategy to reduce churn rate, which I've done using machine learning technique.
